/// Meta Events seem to only exist in the MIDI File Spec. Here is what it says about them:
/// A few meta-events are defined herein. It is not required for every program to support every meta-event.
///
/// In the syntax descriptions for each of the meta-events a set of conventions is used to describe parameters of the
/// events. The FF which begins each event, the type of each event, and the lengths of events which do not have a
/// variable amount of data are given directly in hexadecimal. A notation such as dd or se, which consists of two
/// lower-case letters, mnemonically represents an 8-bit value. Four identical lower-case letters such as wwww refer to
/// a 16-bit value, stored most-significant-byte first. Six identical lower-case letters such as tttttt refer to a
/// 24-bit value, stored most-significant-byte first. The notation len refers to the length portion of the meta-event
/// syntax, that is, a number, stored as a variable-length quantity, which specifies how many data bytes follow it in
/// the meta-event. The notations text and data refer to however many bytes of (possibly text) data were just specified
/// by the length.
///
/// In general, meta-events in a track which occur at the same time may occur in any order. If a copyright event is
/// used, it should be placed as early as possible in the file, so it will be noticed easily. Sequence Number and
/// Sequence/Track Name events, if present, must appear at time 0. An end-of-track event must occur as the last event in
